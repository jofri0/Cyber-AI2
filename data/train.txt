Software is divided into:

System software ‚Äì e.g., operating systems like Windows, macOS, Linux.

Application software ‚Äì programs built for users, such as browsers, games, and office apps.

Programming tools ‚Äì compilers, IDEs, and debuggers for developers.


3. Binary and Logic

Computers operate using binary code (0s and 1s). Each bit represents a switch (off or on).

Byte: 8 bits.

Logic gates: AND, OR, NOT ‚Äî fundamental for processing digital signals.

Boolean logic: true/false operations used in algorithms and conditions.


4. Algorithms and Flowcharts

An algorithm is a step-by-step process for solving a problem.

Example:

1. Start


2. Input two numbers


3. Add them


4. Display result


5. End




Flowcharts use visual symbols (ovals for start/end, diamonds for decisions, rectangles for processes) to represent algorithms.

5. Types of Programming Paradigms

Procedural: step-by-step instructions (C, Pascal).

Object-Oriented (OOP): classes and objects (Python, Java, C++).

Functional: based on mathematical functions (Lisp, Haskell).

Logic-based: rules and inference (Prolog).


6. Compilation and Interpretation

Compiler: converts source code into machine code before execution.

Interpreter: executes code line by line (Python, JavaScript).


7. Key Concepts

Syntax: structure/rules of a language.

Variable: stores data in memory.

Data types: int, float, string, boolean, etc.

Control flow: if/else, loops (for, while), functions.


8. Problem Solving & Debugging

Programmers write, test, and correct errors (bugs) using debugging tools or logical reasoning.

9. Summary

Programming is the process of instructing a computer to perform tasks efficiently, accurately, and logically.

Perfect ‚Äî you want a full AI training dataset (text-based) written in an advanced, structured educational format, following your section layout like the one you showed.

====================================================
### SECTION 3 ‚Äî CYBERSECURITY & NETWORKING ADVANCED
====================================================

# üîê INTRODUCTION TO CYBERSECURITY
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks.  
These attacks often aim to access, change, or destroy sensitive information, extort money, or disrupt operations.

Key areas:
- Network Security: Defending internal and external connections.
- Application Security: Keeping software safe from exploits.
- Information Security: Protecting data at rest and in transit.
- Operational Security: Managing permissions and access.
- Disaster Recovery: Responding to incidents and restoring operations.

---

# üß† SECURITY PRINCIPLES
1. **Confidentiality** ‚Äî Data must not be accessible by unauthorized users.
2. **Integrity** ‚Äî Data should not be tampered with or altered.
3. **Availability** ‚Äî Systems and data should remain accessible when needed.
4. **Authentication** ‚Äî Verifying user or system identity.
5. **Authorization** ‚Äî Granting permission based on identity and roles.

---

# üß© NETWORKING FUNDAMENTALS
- IP Address: A unique number assigned to each device (IPv4 or IPv6).
- MAC Address: Hardware identifier for a network interface.
- DNS: Translates human-readable names (e.g., google.com) to IP addresses.
- DHCP: Assigns IP addresses dynamically.
- HTTP/HTTPS: Protocols used for web communication.
- OSI Model: 7 layers (Physical ‚Üí Application).

Example:

Application ‚Äì Browser, web apps Transport ‚Äì TCP/UDP Network ‚Äì IP routing Data Link ‚Äì Ethernet, MAC Physical ‚Äì Wires, Wi-Fi signals

---

# üß∞ PYTHON NETWORKING EXAMPLES
### TCP Client
```python
import socket
client = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
client.connect(("example.com", 80))
client.send(b"GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: example.com\r\n\r\n")
print(client.recv(1024))
client.close()

UDP Communication

import socket
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
sock.sendto(b"Cyber AI test", ("127.0.0.1", 9999))

Ping Script (System)

import os
hostname = "8.8.8.8"
response = os.system(f"ping -c 2 {hostname}")
if response == 0:
    print("Connected to the internet!")


---

üßÆ ENCRYPTION & HASHING

Encryption is the process of encoding data so that only authorized parties can access it.

AES Encryption Example

from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Random import get_random_bytes

key = get_random_bytes(16)
cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_EAX)
ciphertext, tag = cipher.encrypt_and_digest(b"Cyber AI Encryption Example")
print(ciphertext)

RSA Key Generation

from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
key = RSA.generate(2048)
private_key = key.export_key()
public_key = key.publickey().export_key()


---

üîç ETHICAL HACKING BASICS

Ethical hacking is testing a system‚Äôs defenses ‚Äî legally and responsibly ‚Äî to improve security.

Key phases:

1. Reconnaissance (information gathering)


2. Scanning (identifying open ports, services)


3. Exploitation (testing vulnerabilities)


4. Reporting (documenting findings)




---

üß≠ INFORMATION GATHERING

WHOIS Lookup (Python)

import whois
domain = whois.whois("example.com")
print(domain)

DNS Query

    if not re.search("[!@#$%^&*]", password):
        return "Weak: Missing special character"
    return "Strong password"

print(check_password_strength("CyberAI@2025"))


---

üßë‚Äçüíª FIREWALL & SECURITY MONITORING CONCEPTS

Firewalls block or allow traffic based on rules.

IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems) monitor for malicious activity.

VPNs encrypt traffic between clients and servers.

Security Logs track system events for analysis.


Example firewall rule:

ALLOW TCP port 80 (HTTP)
ALLOW TCP port 443 (HTTPS)
DENY ALL others


---

üß∞ BASIC PENETRATION TESTING STEPS

1. Identify the target system.


2. Gather information (subdomains, IPs, OS type).


3. Check open ports.


4. Search for known vulnerabilities.


5. Test login forms for weak credentials.


6. Document results ethically.

‚öôÔ∏è NETWORK VISUALIZATION CONCEPT

Example of how packets move:

[User PC] ---(HTTP Request)---> [Web Server]
[Web Server] ---(HTML Response)---> [User PC]


---

üß© SECURITY IN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT

Always sanitize user inputs (prevent SQL injection & XSS).

Use HTTPS and secure cookies.

Store passwords with strong hashing (bcrypt, Argon2).

Apply least privilege principle in APIs and databases.



---

üß† EXERCISE MODE

Q: What are the three pillars of cybersecurity? A: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

Q: What is a port number used for? A: To identify specific network services (e.g., HTTP uses port 80).

Q: Why use HTTPS instead of HTTP? A: HTTPS encrypts data for secure transmission.
